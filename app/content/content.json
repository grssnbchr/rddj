If you already know Javascript you can use <code>htmlwidgets</code> to create R bindings, so called \"widgets\", to your favourite library. There already exist <a href=\"http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html\">a range of bindings</a>. Widgets are built so that they can be used at the R console (a functionality which <code>rCharts</code> lacks, as far as I know) and embedded into RMarkdown (and thus into a plain HTML file) or a Shiny web app. There even exists a <a href=\"http://www.buildingwidgets.com\">blog</a> to promote building widgets, with lots of how-to's.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Today, making a data journalism project's methodology public is still rather the exception than the rule. If you want to share with your readers what exactly you did with your data, and even allow them to reproduce what you did, R is the ideal setting. Using something called RMarkdown and a package called <code>knitr</code>, you can create nice looking HTML files from your scripts, showing both your (annotated) R code and its output &ndash; which can then be published on your website, on a service such as <a href=\"http://rpubs.com\">RPubs</a> or on GitHub. This blog post gives a nice introduction in the toolstack needed to perform reproducible data journalism with R. If you only want to know how to create HTML files, you can skip the last part about pandoc.</p>"
